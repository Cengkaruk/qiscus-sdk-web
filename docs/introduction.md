## Qiscus Web Chat SDK

Mobile users increased year after year, but it does not mean we can forget Web
App user. There are always people who prefer to use web app rather than their
mobile phone such as developer who always work in front of computer,
customer service administrators or agent who always talk with customers online.

Our Web Chat SDK, for now, supports Chrome 40+, Firefox 48+, and Microsoft Edge.

To start developing your Web App using our Qiscus Chat SDK, You can
[try our sample app](https://github.com/qiscus/qiscus-sdk-web-sample) or you can read
